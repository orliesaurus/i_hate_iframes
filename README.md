==============

Mailjet Widget in PHP instead of that buggy iframe imeplementation.
**This is not yet functional because of a weird behaviour of the Mailjet API which automaitcally creates objects in the database!** More on that later.

#HOW-TO

As of today, you need to edit all files to get the best experience.

* widget.html is just HTML and Javascript that you can customise with your own terms of service and visual styles
* contact.php is just PHP that you can customise with your own messages and yes I'll make it more customisable- this way you can specify everything in a few variables at the top of the file without having to dig into it.
* config.php is just PHP with your own credentials, API and Mailjet related

#BUGS

This is handmade PHP, it's not pretty but it's functional.

#TODO
Make it more customer-friendly. Especially in terms of messages and errors.
Probably a lot more stuff to add here...
